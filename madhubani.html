      <h1>Madhubani Art</h1>
      <p>
        Madhubani painting, also referred to as Mithila Art (as it flourishes in
        the Mithila region of Bihar), is characterized by line drawings filled
        in by bright colours and contrasts or patterns. This style of painting
        has been traditionally done by the women of the region, though today men
        are also involved to meet the demand. These paintings are popular
        because of their tribal motifs and use of bright earthy colours. These
        paintings are done with mineral pigments prepared by the artists. <br><br>
        The work is done on freshly plastered or a mud wall. For commercial
        purposes, the work is now being done on paper, cloth, canvas etc. Cotton
        wrapped around a bamboo stick forms the brush. Black colour is obtained
        by mixing soot with cow dung; yellow from turmeric or pollen or lime and
        the milk of banyan leaves; blue from indigo; red from the kusam flower
        juice or red sandalwood; green from the leaves of the wood apple tree;
        white from rice powder; orange from palasha flowers. The colours are
        applied flat with no shading and no empty space is left. <br>

        <br>
        Figures from nature & mythology are adapted to suit their style. The
        themes & designs widely painted are of Hindu deities such as Krishna,
        Rama, Siva, Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Sun and Moon, Tulasi plant, court
        scenes, wedding scenes, social happenings etc. Floral, animal and bird
        motifs, geometrical designs are used to fill up all the gaps. The skill
        is handed down the generations, and hence the traditional designs and
        patterns are widely maintained.
        <br>
        In order to create a source of non-agricultural income, the All India
        Handicrafts Board and the Government of India have been encouraging the
        women artists to produce their traditional paintings on handmade paper
        for commercial sale. Madhubani painting has become a primary source of
        income for scores of families. The continuing market in this art
        throughout the world is a tribute to the resourcefulness of the women of
        Mithila who have successfully transferred their techniques of bhitti
        chitra or wall painting to the medium of paper.

    <h3><u><i>Styles</i></u></h3>
    <p>
        Mithila art has five distinctive styles: </p>
        <li>Bharni</li>
        <li>Katchni</li>
        <li>Tantrik</li>
        <li>Godna</li>
        <li>Kohbar</li>
        <br>
<p>
In the 1960s, Bharni and Tantrik styles of Madhubani art were predominantly created by Brahmin women in India and Nepal, focusing on religious themes and depictions of gods and goddesses. 
Artists from other castes incorporated elements from their daily lives, local legends like the story of Raja Shailesh, and various symbols into their paintings. 
In contemporary times, Madhubani art has evolved into a global art form, transcending caste distinctions. <br><br> Artists now freely work across all five styles, and Mithila art has gained international recognition.
 Khobar style, also known as puren, is traditionally painted on the wall of a Mithila wedding chamber, where a bride and groom spend their first night together.
  They most often depict circular motifs made up on feminized faces, and lines drawn in red and black ink. There are both Brahman and Kayastha versions of the Khobar style.
